# 📘 Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 1 (Solutions)
> **"From Spaghetti Code to Clean, Controlled, and Scalable Solutions"**

## 🎯 Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the **Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 1** course by **Eng. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**. This is the 4th and most critical course in my programming journey, marking the transition from a "code writer" to a "professional programmer."

The core focus of this repository is not just finding the correct output, but mastering **Code Structure**, **Readability**, and **Maintainability**.

## 🗝️ Learning Philosophy: The "Clean Code" Shift
In this level, I re-solved 50 fundamental problems with a completely new mindset:
* **Divide and Conquer:** Breaking large, complex problems into small, manageable sub-problems.
* **Functions as Building Blocks:** Designing small, focused, and reusable functions.
* **Eliminating Redundancy:** Writing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code to reduce complexity.
* **Scalability:** Building logic that can grow without collapsing.

## 🧱 Repository Structure
Each problem in this repository follows a structured approach:
1.  **Analysis:** Understanding the inputs and required logic.
2.  **Decomposition:** Breaking the logic into sub-problems.
3.  **Implementation:** Connecting functions as building blocks.
