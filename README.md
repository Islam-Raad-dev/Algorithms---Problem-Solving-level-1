# 📘 Algorithms and Problem Solving – Level 1

> **"Programming is not a programming language. A programming language is only a tool. Programming is the art of thinking."**

This repository contains my solutions and progress in the **Algorithms and Problem Solving (Level 1)** course, part of the "Programmer's Roadmap" by Eng. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud.

## 🗝️ About This Course
This course is the foundation of my programming journey. It focuses on the most critical skill for any software or AI engineer: **How to think and solve problems correctly.** The core philosophy here is to **"Learn How to Think Before You Learn How to Code."** I spent this level focusing entirely on logic and problem analysis without being distracted by any programming language syntax.

## 📖 What I Have Learned
Through this level, I have mastered the following skills:
* **Problem Analysis:** Breaking down complex problems into simple, manageable steps.
* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Designing step-by-step solutions logically.
* **Flowcharts:** Using visual tools to represent logic, decision-making, and processes.
* **Logic Design:** Identifying Inputs, Processes, Decisions, and Outputs for any given problem.
* **Independent Thinking:** Solving problems without relying on code syntax.

## 🧱 Course Structure & Practice
This course is 100% practice-driven. It consists of **50 carefully selected problems** that I solved using:
1. **Logical Analysis:** Understanding the requirements and constraints.
2. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Writing down the logical flow.
3. **Flowcharts:** Visualizing the solution.

> 🚫 **Note:** No programming language (like C++ or Python) was used in this level to ensure a deep focus on the "Thinking Process" only.

## 🧠 Why This Level Matters to Me
As a student of **Artificial Intelligence**, I believe that a strong mental foundation in algorithms is what separates a regular coder from a top-tier engineer. These 50 problems have prepared me perfectly for the next step: **C++ Problem Solving.**

## 🏅 Certification
Upon completion, this repository serves as proof of my readiness for coding-based problem solving, verifying my ability to:
- Explain what algorithms are.
- Design clear solutions using flowcharts.
- Approach problems with structure and confidence instead of "trial-and-error".
